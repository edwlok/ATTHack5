# SpectateXR @ AT&T Shape Hackathon 2019

SpectateXR is not a game. We want to offer fans a way to break through the screen and get into a game, and into a live gaming event.

This is accomplished using mobile VR, AR, and immersive 360 video; the tools used were Unity, ARKit, and 360 video editing.

SpectateXR is a platform to deliver live Esports events to its fans in a new and immersive way. We want to partner with game makers, offering this platform to their games. Twitch and Youtube do a good job delivering the available 2D content, but ESports live in a 3D digital world that offers the potential for a much richer experience.

When you put the headset on you'll see our mockup. Imagine a live league of legends championship in progress. In the center you'll see the arena. Above your favorite player you'll see a red arrow, around the field you'll see camera icons. If you select any of those you'll teleport around the game, giving you a custom, user driven experience.

Around the arena you'll see panels with live stream commentators, player cams, player messages; this is the content already available. Also, we wanted to give fans the feeling that they were at a live torunament event. So on the wall you can see a map of the event space, click on the markers to launch live 360 feeds of that space. Imagine those cameras in the stands, on the stage, etc.

Now our prototype embeds much of this content in the app but with the advent of 5G we could live stream that content to the fans. In particular, we hope to stream positional data from within the game, 4k video and 360 video of the event.
